# The Growth of AI and Its Effects on Data
 As the popularity of artificial intelligence has grown tremendously, AI has become more relevant and sometimes complicated in today's discussions on technology. In this document, I will examine and present two oppposing articles that talk about how data is being used in AI.

## Article 1 
In the Economic Times's [AI and Privacy: The privacy concerns surrouding AI, its potential impact on personal data](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/how-to/ai-and-privacy-the-privacy-concerns-surrounding-ai-its-potential-impact-on-personal-data/articleshow/99738234.cms?from=mdr), it is known that AI systems like ChatGPT use massive ammounts of data to train its models. The key difference is that nowadays AI systems collect personal information that some users may not be aware of. Some of the information that AI systems collect are very personal like one's financial information, medical records, and geolocation information. Furthermore, as AI databases grow, the risk and ramifications of data breaches also greatly increase. 

To conclude, it is important to understand the risks of AI systems like ChatGPT and AI technologies have to be more clear about what data is being collected and how the data is being used. Users should also be careful with what information they are providing. 

## Article 2
In the University of St. Augustine for Health Science Editorial's [How AI Is Revolutionizing Healthcare](hhttps://www.usa.edu/blog/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-healthcare/)  AI systems have greatly improved the medical field using medical data and person information. Based on patients' answers to questions, healthcare providers with the help of AI technology can provide a more comprehensive treatment plan as well as predict health risks. By using personal information from patients, AI efficiently diagnose, treat, and manage patients and their health problems. 

To conclude, it is important to understand how data collection can greatly benefit the health care system. By using personal information from patients, AI provides a revolutionary tool that healthcare providers and researchers can use.
